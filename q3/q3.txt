The bug is dangling pointers. The linked list is intialized with nodes, and the binary search tree node's are pointers intialized 
to the elements inside nodes of the linked list. 
Therefore, when list_delete is called, all the nodes, elements, and the list entirely, get freed. 
However, the pointers from the tree to the elements still remain, thus leaving dangling pointers. 
Thus, we need to add reference counting to the elements inside the nodes of the linked list, so when
list_delete gets called the pointers of the tree nodes won't point to freed memory.
